# RaspberryPiPico-RBG-LED-Demo
Basic demo using a WS2812 RGB LED and HD44870 LCD.
Seems that Raspberry Pi Pico is in it's early days and library support is a bit limited, but managed to get this working with some sources on the net.

Modes
### 1 - Colour set
Set colour value of each individual colour (red, green, blue) using a poteniometer

### 2 - Colour show
Using colour value set above, see the resulting colour on the RGB LED.

### 3 - Colour cycle demo
Very basic colour cycle. Red - 0-255, Green 0-255, Blue 0-255.
